*** Abstract
**** Summary
- Were you burned when Google shut down Reader? Do you want a computer you can 
  reach from anywhere? Do you want the cloud without the creepy? Do you just 
  want a playground to improve you linux skills? You should get your own server
  that's super-fast, always on, and always accessible. This talk will introduce 
  the idea of a virtual private server and survey several ways you can use one 
  to improve your life.
**** Bio
- David Lachut is a PhD Candidate in Computer Science at the Univeristy of 
  Maryland, Baltimore County. His research combines home automation and data 
  analysis to build residential energy management systems. His first linux 
  distro was Ubuntu 7.10, Gutsy Gibbon, but now he spends most of his time with
  Debian Testing. And his secret ambition is to live on the starship 
  Enterprise, or at least to do his part to invent the Enterprise's computer.
