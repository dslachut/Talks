* Bio
- David Lachut is a PhD Candidate in Computer Science at the Univeristy of 
  Maryland, Baltimore County. His research combines home automation and data 
  analysis to build residential energy management systems. His first linux 
  distro was Ubuntu 7.10, Gutsy Gibbon, but now he spends most of his time with
  Debian Testing. And his secret ambition is to live on the starship 
  Enterprise, or at least to do his part to invent the Enterprise's computer.
* Home Automation with F/LOSS
- If you're like me, you want to live in the home of the future where automated
  servants treat you like royalty. And, if you're like me, you can't stand the
  idea of running something so important as your home with proprietary 
  software. This talk will overview the current landscape of home-automation
  technology, see where free software can come in to it, and go over the basics
  of automating your own home.
