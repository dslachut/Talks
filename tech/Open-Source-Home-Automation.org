*** Abstract
**** Home Automation with F/LOSS
- If you're like me, you want to live in the home of the future where automated
  servants treat you like royalty. And, if you're like me, you can't stand the
  idea of running something so important as your home with proprietary 
  software. This talk will overview the current landscape of home-automation
  technology, see where free software can come in to it, and go over the basics
  of automating your own home.
**** Bio
- David Lachut is a PhD Candidate in Computer Science at the Univeristy of 
  Maryland, Baltimore County. His research combines home automation and data 
  analysis to build residential energy management systems. His first linux 
  distro was Ubuntu 7.10, Gutsy Gibbon, but now he spends most of his time with
  Debian Testing. And his secret ambition is to live on the starship 
  Enterprise, or at least to do his part to invent the Enterprise's computer.

*** Home Automation is HUGE!
- "By 2017, 90% of all Samsung products will be IoT devices â€” and that includes 
  all our televisions and mobile devices. And [by 2020], every single piece of 
  Samsung hardware will be an IoT device, whether it is an air purifier or an 
  oven." - BK Yoon, President & CEO of Samsung
- Google: Brillo, Nest
- Apple: HomeKit
- Xfinity Home
*** My dissertation research uses home automation tools

*** Home Automation needs Open Source
- The only thing more personal than your home is your own body
  - Code must be trustworthy
  - Code must be under our control
  - If you don't own the code running your home, you don't own your home
- We need an "Internet of Things that do what we tell them" (Cory Doctorow, 
  /Solid Conference 2015/)
* Overview of Home Automation
** Home Automation Protocols
*** There are very many home automation standards
